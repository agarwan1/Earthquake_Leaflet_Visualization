# Visualize Global Earthquake Data
In this project, I have visualized earthquakes occurring globally using a live API feed provided by the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The data in the feed is updated every 5 mins, and includes all earthquake data for the Past 7 Days. The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change.
